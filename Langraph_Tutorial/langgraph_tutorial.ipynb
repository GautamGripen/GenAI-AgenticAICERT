    "- In LangGraph, a StateGraph is a core component that represents a computational graph designed to manage and update a shared, central state as a workflow progresses through its defined nodes and edges. It is a blueprint or structure that dictates how different functions, tools, or steps (nodes) are connected and how data (the state) flows between them.\n",

    "- Imagine we have 3 nodes (Node1, Node2 & Node3), Node1 does addition, Node2 does Subtraction & Node3 does Multiplication. Now each of this Node will produce an ouput, which can be used as input to another Node. So here, StateGraph will store those outputs of each node into it like a memory which can be utilised by other nodes. Imagine StateGraph like an Inventory Or a Blueprint........\n",
